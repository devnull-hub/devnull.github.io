Automatically add lastmod field using Git metadata Automatically add the lastmod field to each article based on Git information.\nUpdate enableGitInfo in config.toml\nSet enableGitInfo to true in our config.toml.\nenableGitInfo = true The lastmod field will default to the most recent commit date for that file in Git.\nUpdate frontmatter in config.toml\nIf enableGitInfo is true, it will override any lastmod dates in front matter.\nBy default, :git comes before lastmod. To override add the following lines to the config file to config.toml\nenableGitInfo = true [frontmatter] date = [\u0026#34;date\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;publishDate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;lastmod\u0026#34;] lastmod = [\u0026#34;lastmod\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;:git\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;publishDate\u0026#34;] publishDate = [\u0026#34;publishDate\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;date\u0026#34;] expiryDate = [\u0026#34;expiryDate\u0026#34;] Note\rThis approach is not recommended, since changes to a Git file may not always correlate to changes in the article content. It could simply be a minor style change or other changes that aren’t relevant to the content.\r2. Manually add lastmod to front matter Second approach is to manually add lastmod fields to front matter whenever an article is updated.\nWe want the Last Modified date to show only if we explicitly set it in the front matter.\nAdd lastmod to front matter\nAdd the lastmod field to our article front matter:\ndate: \u0026#34;2022-01-10\u0026#34; lastmod: \u0026#34;2022-01-15\u0026#34; Info\rIf enableGitInfo is true, lastmod will be set to the most recent commit date for that file and override any lastmod dates.\nCange this behavior by configuring front matter dates: [\u0026quot;lastmod\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;date\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;publishDate\u0026quot;]\nCreated a simple partial template This partial template checks if the lastmod and publish dates are the same then renders the dates. Compare two dates, Jan 2, 2006 is equal to mm.dd.yyyy.\nCreate lastmod.html\n{{ $date := .Date.UTC.Format \u0026#34;Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }} {{ $lastmod := .Lastmod.UTC.Format \u0026#34;Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;li class=\u0026#34;list-inline-item d-flex align-items-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;fas fa-calendar me-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; \u0026lt;span\u0026gt;Published on {{ $date }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li class=\u0026#34;list-inline-item d-flex align-items-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;i class=\u0026#34;fas fa-calendar me-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; {{ if ne $lastmod $date }} \u0026lt;span\u0026gt; Edited on {{ $lastmod }}\u0026lt;/span\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; In single.html or post.html this can be called with the following {{ partial \u0026quot;lastmod.html\u0026quot; . }}\nSummary Minor update to improve information.\nCheck out the something interesting: Hugo Improve Usability ","date":"December 29, 2022","image":"https://devnall.io/images/post/hugo-logo_hu5ff7678116e37e4148cba01ab439f068_13782_650x0_resize_box_3.png","permalink":"/blog/hugo/tips/lastmod-date/","title":"Add a Last Modified Date in Hugo Articles"},{"categories":["github","git"],"contents":"GIT OOPS!

If not, I suggest reading through the Git Handbook.\nIt is also important to note that you should follow your team\u0026rsquo;s conventions\nThe Anatomy of a Commit Message Basic: git commit -m \u0026lt;message\u0026gt; Detailed:\ngit commit -m \u0026lt;title\u0026gt; -m \u0026lt;description\u0026gt; Tthoughtful commits, consider the following:\nWhy have I made these changes? What effect have my changes made? Why was the change needed? What are the changes in reference to? Assume the reader does not understand what the commit is addressing.\nMake clear why that change was made, and note if it is crucial for the functionality or not.\nExample:\ngit commit -m \u0026#39;Add wdiget\u0026#39; git commit -m \u0026#39;Add wdiget to nav items to prevent them from overlapping the logo\u0026#39; Tip\rVScode Git Blame extension adds git blame information to your vscode compatible view. Git historical information are Git History and GitLens.\rExample commit types:\nfeat – a new feature is introduced with the changes fix – a bug fix has occurred chore – changes that do not relate to a fix or feature and don\u0026rsquo;t modify src or test files (for example updating dependencies) refactor – refactored code that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature docs – updates to documentation such as a the README or other markdown files style – changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, likely related to code formatting such as white-space, missing semi-colons, and so on. test – including new or correcting previous tests perf – performance improvements ci – continuous integration related build – changes that affect the build system or external dependencies revert – reverts a previous commit Full Conventional Commit Example fix: fix foo to enable bar This fixes the broken behavior of the component by doing xyz. BREAKING CHANGE Before this fix foo wasn\u0026#39;t enabled at all, behavior changes from \u0026lt;old\u0026gt; to \u0026lt;new\u0026gt; Closes XXXX-12345 Example conventions, it\u0026rsquo;s helpful to include guidelines for commits in a contributing or README markdown file within your projects.\nLearn more about Conventional Commit SemVer.org and here.\nCommit Message Comparisons Good feat: improve performance with lazy load for images chore: update python dependency to latest version fix: bug preventing users from submitting the subscribe form update: incorrect client phone number within footer body per client request Bad fixed bug on landing page Changed style oops I think I fixed it this time? empty commit messages Summary Writing good commit messages is an extremely beneficial skill, and it helps to communicate and collaborate.

This post will step cover publishing and pushing the newest content to GitHub Pages.\nSuggested reading Getting Started with Hugo: Learn more on GitHub. Complete documentation is available at Hugo Documentation.\nStep 1. Create Repositories on GitHub Assumptions already familiar with git commands and GitHub.\nCreate two repos\nName Access Purpose blog public Working local edits for changing adding content myblog.github.io public Syncing output of public folder to github or web server GitHub Pages There are two types of GitHub Pages:\nUser/Organization Pages https://\u0026lt;USERNAME|ORGANIZATION\u0026gt;.github.io/ Project Pages https://\u0026lt;USERNAME|ORGANIZATION\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026lt;PROJECT\u0026gt;/ Step 2. Create New Site With hugo command create new site blog and change into the directory:\nhugo new site blog cd to blog Run initialize the directory as a git repository\ngit init Initialized empty Git repository... Add the github repository as a remote using git remote\nSubstitute \u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt; with your username.\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/blog.git git fetch --all git pull origin main At this point need to choose a them to continue.\nChoose themes Step 3. Installation theme Using the mainroad theme.\nFrom the project\u0026rsquo;s blog root directory, run:\ngit clone https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad\nNote\rIf not planning to making any significant changes but want to track and update the theme, add it as a git submodule via the following command:\rgit submodule add https://github.com/vimux/mainroad.git themes/mainroad Edit config.toml\nSpecify mainroad as default theme in the config.toml file.\ntheme = \u0026#34;mainroad\u0026#34; Change baseurl baseurl = \u0026quot;https://github.com/myblog-hub/myblog.github.io/\u0026quot; this is what will be pointing at the public part of the repo.\nInfo\rMake sure to end baseurl with a / and also confirm baseurl is set to Project Pages https://\u0026lt;USERNAME|ORGANIZATION\u0026gt;.github.io/\u0026lt;PROJECT\u0026gt;/ If any problems when publishing tweak until works.\rStep 5. Preview site locally From the project\u0026rsquo;s blog root directory, run:\nhugo server ... TRUNCATED OUTPUT ... Watching for config changes in C:\\..\\..\\blog\\myblog.github.io\\config.toml Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1) ... TRUNCATED OUTPUT ... Open browser to http://localhost:1313\nStep 4. Create New Posts Syntax to create a new post: hugo new posts/POST_NAME.md\nCreate a post called mypost.md hugo new posts/mypost.md this creates a directory named posts\nInfo\rDepending on the theme this might need to be updated in the configuration config.toml as might be reference as post.\rStep 5. Production repo setup In production repo need to make sure have one commit and main branch if this was not already done through GitHub Page.\nIf README.md not added to remote repo then complete following or just add submodule\ngit clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/myblog.github.io cd myblog.github.io git checkout -b main add README.md git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;adding readme.md\u0026#34; git push origin main Add Submodule From the project\u0026rsquo;s blog root directory add submodule, run:\ngit submodule add -b main https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/myblog.github.io.git public Warning\rThis might fail due to running hugo server cammand, just delete the public folder it will get recreated.\rStep 6. Generate static files Run with the theme used mainroad\nhugo -t mainroad Confirm public dir has been created.\n. ├── archetypes ├── assets ├── config ├── config.toml ├── content ├── data ├── layouts ├── netlify.toml ├── **public** ├── resources ├── static └── themes Confirm remote repo has been added git remote -v:\ngit remote -v origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/myblog.github.io.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/myblog.github.io.git (push) Commit changes to production repo:\ncd public git add . git commit -m \u0026#34;init commit\u0026#34; git push origin main Step 7. GitHub Pages From the https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/myblog.github.io.git Settings page check Pages section and make sure Branch main /root is selected.\nCheck the actions page and can monitor the workflows deployment.\nIdeas Hosting on Azure Azure storage static Azure Pipelines Azure Container Registry Azure Container Registry Tasks Hosting on AWS Cloudflare Summary The setup is great now website under full source control, build it anytime and host it literally anywhere.
